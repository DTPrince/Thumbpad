v2
- flex-clips were added to 3 edges to grab the PCB
- 2 alignment pins were added to the base of the shell/housing


v3
- collars were added to change attachment style to use the PCB M3 mounting holes.
- swivelhousing underwent a shave to remove straight edges from the interior to alleviate rubbing
- swivel housing has fillet inner rim for better 45deg/angled movement
- contact arms have fillets on the tips to improve rocking.
	- may be irrelevant when fully assembled





future updates:
maybe alignment arms inside the housings to keep contact arms fully centered instead of fillet/chamfer pseudo-alignment
