v2
- flex-clips were added to 3 edges to grab the PCB
- 2 alignment pins were added to the base of the shell/housing


v3
- collars were added to change attachment style to use the PCB M3 mounting holes.
- swivelhousing underwent a shave to remove straight edges from the interior to alleviate rubbing
- swivel housing has fillet inner rim for better 45deg/angled movement
- contact arms have fillets on the tips to improve rocking.
	- may be irrelevant when fully assembled

v4
- added pockets for the swivel contact/arms for a tight fit to remove excess wiggling
- added some fusions for assembly exports and explode assemblies
- top was flattened so it can print on it's top without ugly support surfaces

v5
- Changed switches to smaller-micro forms
 - Includes cutouts on the ends for tabbed SMD mounts
 - shrank footprint considerably, further xy reductions are mostly in the realm of choosing a new connector interface
- changed PCB out to new PCB
- Socket now extends down to the PCB and outershell collars for back-side M3 screws
- fasteners updated
- naming convention cleaned up more
- fusions for STL exports made separate parts
