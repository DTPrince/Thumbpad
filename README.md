# Thumbpad
3d CAD repo for thumb pad


## TODO (lol)
tighten tolerance around inner swivel. Both vertically and constrain twisting around the contact arms

fix STL export (specifically mounting collars/attachment method) so I don't have to fuse to export anymore like a dingus
fix explode assembly to do the entire shell at once instead of in 5 steps

With the alignment pins there is no longer a good orientation to print the shell. Maybe who cares maybe not.

future updates:
maybe alignment arms inside the housings to keep contact arms fully centered instead of fillet/chamfer pseudo-alignment
add blocks to 3d-print pcb for pins/bolts clearance
